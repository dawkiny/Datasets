Wafer Database
The wafer database comprises a collection of time-series data sets where each file contains the sequence of measurements recorded by one vacuum-chamber sensor during the etch process applied to one silicon wafer during the manufacture of semiconductor microelectronics. Each wafer has an assigned classification of normal or abnormal. The abnormal wafers are representative of a range of problems commonly encountered during semiconductor manufacturing.
